# Help:
Issues with Frogman Engine Header Tool:  
- It is highly probable that the file or path string encoding issue is causing the problem.  
- The header tool requires header files and the copy of a license text file to be encoded with UTF8 with BOM(Byte Order Mark) signature.  

To run the header tool with CMake, call the CMake function:
```CMake
# The first argument is the header file paths, and the second argument is the options to the tool. 
# The tool will not properly work without wrapping " " around the each argument.  
# The each header file path and the each option must be seperated with a semi-colon ';'.  
RUN_HEADER_TOOL("${FE_LOG_HEADERS};${FE_POOL_HEADERS};${FE_CORE_HEADERS};${FE_MISC_HEADERS}" "-max-concurrency=8;-path-to-copyright-notice=${FE_CORE_CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../../LICENSE.txt;-fno-reflection-helper")  
```

Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Runtime Library:
- The default settings use /MTd (Static C++ Standard Library Debug Build) for debug configuration and /MT (Static C++ Standard Library Release Build) for release.  

To run Google Benchmarks on Windows:
```CMake
LINK_LIBRARIES(advapi32.lib shlwapi.lib) # to use Google Benchmark on Windows.  
```

In order to build boost libraries using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Clang CL (this does not work with Windows SDK version 10.0.26100.0):
1. Download the LLVM Clang CL from Visual Studio Installer.  
2. Download Boost libraries from https://www.boost.org/  
3. Build b2.exe by running bootstrap.bat(.sh)  
4. Run the commands:  
```commands
./b2 toolset=clang-win architecture=x86 address-model=64 link=static runtime-link=static threading=multi variant=debug  
./b2 toolset=clang-win architecture=x86 address-model=64 link=static runtime-link=static threading=multi variant=release  
```
